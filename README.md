# RollBalliOS

## User Story
1. User opens app, arrives at main menu screen, and presses start.
2. User rolls ball through maze and collects 13 cubes spread across maze.
3. Win menu appears and user can reset the maze, return to home screen, or go on to the next maze.
4. Repeat until all mazes are complete (currently 2 mazes)

## Technologies Used

- Unity
- XCode
- C#

## What is Unfinished
App is complete but will need more mazes built out before going to the app store. Additionally, the main menu will need a new background image and a final win screen will be added.

## Incoming Updates
- A timer for completeing the mazes
- Keeping track of high scores
